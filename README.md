# Description

Machine learning project using logistic regression, written from scratch (without any librairy like scikit learn etc).

## Installation

In order to see this project you need to install jupyter notebook.
For that, you can easily follow this link which explains very well how to do install Jupyter, with terminal :

## Usage

Just launch Jupyter Notebook, and then open the cancer.ipynb file !
The file is separated into two parts :
- The processing part which consists in analyzing the data
- The Logistic regression part where you'll find the code for this algorithm, from scratch (i hope that you've some math knowledge :))

By the way, you can notice that the processing part is quite short, the reason for that is that I focused a lot more on the algorithm part.
