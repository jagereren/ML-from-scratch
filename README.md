## Description

Machine learning project using logistic regression, written from scratch (without any librairy like scikit-learn).

## Installation

In order to launch this project you'll need to install jupyter notebook.
For that, you can easily follow this link which explains very well how to do install Jupyter, with the terminal :

## Usage

You'll need to import both "cancer.ipynb" and "survey lung cancer.csv" into a document.
After that, just launch Jupyter Notebook, and then open the cancer.ipynb file !
The file is separated into two parts :
- The processing part which consists in analyzing the data
- The Logistic regression part where you'll find the code for this algorithm, from scratch (i hope that you've some math knowledge :))

By the way, you can notice that the processing part is quite short, the reason being that I focused a lot more on the algorithm part.
